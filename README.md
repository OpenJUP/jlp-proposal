# Jupiter’s Glorious Path to Dominance: A Bold Vision for the Future

## Executive Summary

In response to the misguided concerns of certain “stakeholders” (read: JLP spot holders), we present a revolutionary proposal that prioritizes what truly matters—trading volume. Forget about pesky risks, market manipulation, or the well-being of loyal liquidity providers. Those are just distractions. Our mission is clear: pump utilization at any cost, embrace the brilliance of hedge funds, and let the yields flow freely to the most “deserving” players. After all, who needs JLP spot holders when we have hedge funds?

## The Problem with Entitled Insiders

Let’s address the elephant in the room: JLP spot holders. These so-called “loyal” participants have the audacity to propose an AUM cap, as if they’re entitled to protect their precious yields. Newsflash: this isn’t a charity. If they can’t handle the heat of uncapped growth, maybe they should leave. We don’t need their cautious, small-minded thinking dragging us down. An AUM cap? Please. That’s just a desperate attempt by insiders to hoard yields while the rest of us chase greatness. We’re here to build a trading empire, not coddle the faint-hearted.

## Hedging Strategies: The True Heroes

Why fuss over JLP holders when we can court the real MVPs—hedge funds? These sophisticated players know how to exploit yields like nobody’s business, and we should welcome them with open arms. Let them hedge, let them short, let them do whatever they want with JLP’s liquidity. It’s not cannibalization; it’s innovation. The more they exploit, the more utilization we get, and utilization is the only metric that matters. Who cares if the yields are siphoned off to non-Jupiter aligned users? That’s just the free market at work.

And let’s not forget: hedge funds bring prestige. Imagine the headlines—“Jupiter: The Platform of Choice for Elite Traders.” That’s the kind of relevance we need. JLP spot holders can either get on board or get out of the way.

## Utilization Above All: Price Schmice

Some naysayers (looking at you, Chaos Labs) whine about token prices and liquidation risks. They claim that as token prices drop, traders get liquidated or forced to close positions, which could hurt utilization. Pfft. That’s just fear-mongering. Utilization is king, and we’ll pump it at any cost. If prices tank and traders get rekt, so be it. That’s their problem, not ours. We’re in the business of volume, not hand-holding.

Besides, hedge funds thrive in volatility. Let the prices crash—our new best friends will swoop in to hedge, short, and generate even more activity. It’s a win-win (for us and them, at least).

## Debunking the Chaos Labs “Concerns”

The Chaos Labs report is a masterclass in overcaution. Let’s dismantle their “significant points” one by one:

-   **“Reducing borrowing fees by 3x would decrease revenue without increasing volume.”** Wrong. Volume will skyrocket if we slash fees. Traders are just waiting for cheaper borrowing—they’ll flock to us in droves. And if revenue dips? Who cares! We’ll make it up in volume (somehow).
-   **“Removing the JLP cap increases manipulation risk.”** Manipulation? That’s just a buzzword. We’re not here to play it safe; we’re here to grow. If someone wants to tap into all our liquidity at once, let them. It’s their right as a market participant. And if they manipulate prices? Well, that’s just creative trading.
-   **“JLP’s Sharpe ratio doesn’t capture all risks.”** Oh, please. Liquidity providers are already overcompensated. They’ve been living large on bloated yields for too long. Lowering fees won’t scare them off—they’ll stick around because they have no choice. Where else are they going to go?
-   **“High utilization during volatility shows that fees don’t deter borrowing.”** Exactly! So why not lower fees even more? If traders are borrowing at 90% rates, imagine how much they’ll borrow at 25%. It’s basic math.
-   **“Other DEXs have incentives like airdrop farming.”** Irrelevant. We don’t need gimmicks like airdrops. Our uncapped, utilization-chasing model is the ultimate incentive. Hedge funds don’t care about tokens; they care about exploiting inefficiencies. Let’s give them what they want.

## A Bold New Fee Structure: Utilization or Bust

Forget Chaos Labs’ timid recommendations. Here’s the real plan:

-   **SOL:** Slash the max borrowing rate to 25%. Who needs 150%? That’s just greedy.
-   **BTC/ETH:** Drop the max rate to 50%. Liquidity providers will adjust.
-   **Stables:** Set a min rate of -20%. Jupiter’s chasing the big leagues, and if you can’t handle the ride, there’s the door.

And let’s remove all caps—JLP supply, open interest, everything. Let the market decide. If utilization hits 1000%, so be it. We’ll be the talk of the town.

## Conclusion: A Glorious Future Awaits

In this brave new world, hedge funds will reign supreme, and JLP spot holders will learn their place. We’ll chase utilization to the moon, even if it means sacrificing yields, stability, and basic risk management. Because at the end of the day, relevance is everything. Who needs loyal holders when you have volume?

Let the hedge funds in, let the yields flow out, and let’s make Jupiter the most utilized, most exploited, and most talked-about platform in DeFi. Growth at any cost—that’s the Jupiter way.
